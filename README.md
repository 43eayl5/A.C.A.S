| The engine runs on a completely different tab than the chess game page, completely isolated from it. The site cannot block the usage of A.C.A.S. | A.C.A.S sends move data via [CommLink](https://github.com/AugmentedWeb/CommLink) and the userscript displays the data on the board using [UniversalBoardDrawer](https://github.com/Hakorr/UniversalBoardDrawer). (*If "Display Moves On External Site" setting is activated!*) |


<h2 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I prefer <u>A.C.A.S</u> over other similar userscripts?</h2>

        <li>Built for you, not for the greed of the developer</li>
        <li>No anti-features (e.g. ads, tracking)</li>
        <li>Support developers who value quality over quantity and aren't doing shady practices</li>
    </ul>

        <small style="color:lightGrey;">If you found a userscript that has more features and doesn't have anti-features, that's great, you should use it instead of A.C.A.S! This message is against developers stealing code and making cheap copies of existing scripts to fill them with ads and to profit from users. It's absolutely disgusting behaviour and takes away from all of us. Please always prefer userscripts without any anti-features, otherwise it will just encourage more and more developers to use anti-features.</small>
